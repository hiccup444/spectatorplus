A **host-only** spectator mod designed specifically for competitive games. SpectatorPlus transforms the lobby host into a dedicated spectator, allowing them to observe any player in the game without interfering with gameplay.

  

##  **Purpose**

  

SpectatorPlus is designed for competitive gaming scenarios where you need a dedicated observer who can:

- Monitor all players without affecting the game

- Provide commentary or analysis

- Ensure fair play by watching for rule violations

- Create content without disrupting the competitive experience

  

##  **Host-Only Security**

  

This mod is **exclusively** for lobby hosts and will not function for regular players. This ensures:

- Only the game creator can use spectator mode
